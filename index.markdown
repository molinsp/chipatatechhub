<h1> About us</h1>
<p>
The **Chipata** Tech Hub was started by a group of ambitious people trying to make a difference through technology. We want to create innovations that change how people work, helping people to become more efficient and deliver better services. We strongly believe ICT technologies will change everything, and we want to be the ones driving that change.
</p>

<p>
But every journey has to start somewhere, and this is the reason we decided to start with a website design service. We believe an online presence is the first step towards adoption of complex ICT technologies and this gives us the opportunity to build relationships with clients and show the way we work and the quality we deliver.

If you are interested in what we are doing or just want to meet our team, you are more than welcome to come for coffee or tea at our office!
